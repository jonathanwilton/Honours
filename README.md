# Time Series Forecasting using Deep Neural Networks
Ensemble of autoregressive deep neural networks for time series forecasting that explicitly handles skewness, heavy-taildness and heteroscedasticity. Model selection and hyperparameter tuning is performed automatically using Bayesian Optimisation. 

## Requirements
The current implementation makes use of the following Python packages (more recent versions are compatible, however older version may not be):
```
torch '1.7.0'
numpy '1.18.1'
pandas '1.1.1'
matplotlib '2.2.5'
sklearn '0.22.2'
scipy '1.5.2'
AutoDF.py 
```
